        Just a guy who was born and raised on a faraway island called CuraÃ§ao.
        Whom by the grace of God has the opportunity to study Computer Science
        at The University of British Columbia. My academic interests include Web
        development (specifically backend), system-level programming such as OS
        development and compiler construction (BTW I use Rust), interested in
        WASM and its potential. Dabbling in and very eager to learn more about
        machine learning. I am curious and excited to build and learn more
        things in this field. Other interests include: Swimming (I am from an
        island so this is a given), music (I'm learning the guitar), biking, and
        the gym. Below is a display of some of the projects I have/am working
        on, feel free to check them out! Thanks for dropping by! I would love to
        talk to you, just scroll down and leave a message, I will try to reply
        ASAP! Oh, and did I tell you?.....By the way.....I use Rust ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚!
