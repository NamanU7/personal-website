        Just a guy who was born and raised on a faraway island called Curacao.
        Whom by the grace of God has the opportunity to study Computer Science
        at The University of British Columbia. My academic interests include Web
        development (specifically backend), system-level programming such as OS
        development and compiler construction (BTW I use Rust), interested in
        WASM and its potential, and dabbling and eager to learn more about
        Machine Learning. I am curious and eager to build and learn more things
        in this field. Other interests include: Swimming (I am from an island so
        this is a given), music (I'm learning the guitar), biking, and the gym.
        Below is a display of some of the projects I have/am working on. Thanks
        for dropping by! I would love to talk to you, just scroll down and leave
        a message, I will try to reply fast! Oh, and did I tell you? I use Rust
        by the way ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚!
